# Sketch of the Story
✅ The family venture into the forest, Jenny hears a sound. Leila sees what it is, and is scared.

⏳ The story of why they need to go to the forest. The plague of scarsenblack, which approaches their block, the need for wise wood to cross the seas.

⏳ Making camp, Christa appears and is talking to Frank. Christa thinks they have a duty to go take impressions and samples, to help the fight against the plague. Jenny wandering off to see whe thing with her hamster and her shaky gem light. She finds the wierd things and jumps into the portal. Back at camp Frank's gem shatters, they rehydrate the tiger, get torches, and head off into the woods.

⏳  Jenny is a frog, is told the backstory. The thing is a visitor, from a place where indivuals are all a bit blurry, more collectives. It arrived many years ago when there was no forest and couldn't get home. It made the forest to hide itself, and to pull trace minerals from the ground. They're almost ready to go home.

⏳ Jenny opens her eyes, she's sitting under the portal, in the grass, covered by the dancing pastel lights. Her parents arrive and are terrified, but Jenny calms them. This isn't the plague. Christa takes samples, and Ferd takes spirit readings.

⏳  They get their wood, and return to the block. The wood is good, their ship is ready quickly. But has decided not to go, she needs to travel to the lands to the east of the forest, where the plague has spread, she needs to help. She borrows her mother's age, and they sell almost all of their dehydrated menangerie for a spell to bring them back together one year from now. Fred and young Christa sail watch Jenny go, then set sail.
