# We Begin

A single wagon makes its way along a path on a wide plane. It’s a bound canvas roof over a wood base, being driven by a man sitting atop on a small wooden support, and his large and hairy pony. On the back sits a girl, Jenny’s legs dangling over the road as she watches the it emerging and rolling away back towards the block where she came from, a coastal village now far out of sight.

Ahead, the path turns to follow the edge of a forest. Even this far away, the trees loom, each at least hundred meters tall, bushy, and deep green. The space between their enormous trunks seems to breathe, inhaling the outside into its still darkness. Jenny’s ear prickles, staring into those spaces (each big enough to swallow two or three of her family’s wagons side by side!), she can hear something. A slow rhythmic thumping. 

Jenny squints, trying to make out something, sure of the sound now. She hears a noise from inside the wagon and sees Leila, their eagle, is twitching and cocking her head ‘what is it Leila, do you hear it too?’.

‘Yes,’ Leila replies ‘it’s not a good sound’.

‘So do you know what it is?’ Jenny asks

‘Never heard anything like this, very strange’

‘You can’t know it’s no good then. I’m going to go ask dad.’ Jenny climbs up into the roof of the wagon, her parents tell her soon she’s going to be too big to crawl over the fabric without falling through, she doesn’t like the idea, but she’s pretty sure there’s some advantages to being older too. Like being able to tell boys what to do. She crawls up next to her father, a huge and square man with a beard, starting firmly at the road ahead. ‘There’s a sound coming from the forest’ she says ‘Leila can hear it too, she’s worried’.

‘The forest makes lots of sounds’ her father said ‘things Leila hasn’t heard before, you shouldn’t worry’

‘That’s what I said,’ Jenny exclaims, but even now she can still hear the thud, and earths scrape, just at the edge of her attention. So soft, yet it makes the hairs on her neck stand up when she focuses in on it. ‘But Dad, this is a strange sound, listen you can hear it’

A pause. ‘There’s nothing’ her father says.

‘What, yes there is, listen!’ She gestures at the forest. Frederick’s gaze doesn’t shift from the road. 

‘I don’t hear a thing poppet, just the birds and this wagon on the road.’ Jenny is agog, and sits next to him for a minute more fidgeting. But adults are like this sometimes, incapable of seeing even the most obvious things. Making up her mind she climbs down into the wagon, through the front this time and startling Leila as Jenny pushes through a split in the canvas wall and lands on their counter next to Leila’s perch.

‘What did he say?’

‘He doesn’t hear it, and even if he did he said there’s lots new in the forest and we shouldn’t be worried’

‘What does that mean?’ Asks Leila, ignoring her, Jenny continues

‘Still, I don’t think it sounds right. I’m not saying it’s dangerous!’ She says, catching Leila’s smug preening ‘But I want to go check it out.’ She takes Leila out to the back of wagon and whispers in her ear ‘just see what it is and come back ok.’ Leila nuzzles her cheek, then hops off her arm and away into the air, circling to gain height before soaring over the tops of those giant trees.

The sun is getting low, and they road is following against the edge of the forest now, the steady clip clopping of the pony’s hooves usually steady rhythm to the last days, is now a painful keeper of the time for Jenny. Finally she can’t stand it, she rushes up to her dad- ‘Dad, I send Leila into the forest to check on the sound, and she’s still not come back, it feels like it’s been hours.’ 

Frederik jerks his head to look at his daughter, she she shrinks back, there’s clear a look of… fear on his face. It’s not a look she’s used to seeing on her Dad. Just then, there’s a high pitched call from the behind them on the path, and Leila shoots out from between the trees, curving tightly and shooting towards their wagon. Fredrick’s face is composed now, stern, and brings the wagon to a halt before climbing in after Jenny who’s already stroking and holding Leila close. 

‘There’s something in there, something between the trees, Leila’s saying, ‘many things that work together, they make their own light in the shade and and… they saw me’, she sounds panicked. ‘They didn’t try to do anything, but I could feel them watching. They didn’t feel like… like other animals, not like people. They didn’t feel like nature’ Then Leila is silent, just bird squarks coming from her.

Jenny looks road and her dad had taken the special record off the record player which catches Leila’s thought and lets them hear what she’s saying. ‘That’s enough for today’ he says, radiating finality, ‘Jenny you shouldn’t have sent Leila into the forest without telling me, we have to be careful while we visit’.

‘Dad,’ Jenny says quietly, ‘do we still have to go?’ She knows the answer before it comes. Fredrick places one of his enourmas hands on her shoulder and says

‘Yes, we still have to go. But we won’t be cutting into the forest for a while yet. Leila, you flew straight from… what you saw back to the path?’ Leila bobs her head in agreement ‘We’ll be some way from what Leila saw. A different part of the forest. The merchant’s house has been there for a long time, we shouldn’t have any trouble if we’re careful.’  He hugs Jenny close, then carries her up with him to the riders perch. She sits on his lap as they set off, and watches as the path turns and begins to wind between the trees.
